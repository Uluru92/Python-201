'''
Using the tweepy package, build a script that separates twitter handles
into different groups according to the number of their followers.

The classes can be whatever you like (e.g. I used ASCII art birds ;)

CHALLENGE: Also fetch the number of their friends and display the ratio
between followers and friends in an interesting way.

# NOTE:
# Due to recent changes in Twitter's API access policies, the free developer
# tier provides very limited access to user data,  endpoints are
# restricted or unavailable. This prevents fetching follower/friend counts 
# for arbitrary users or even reading tweets reliably.
# 
# Therefore, I could not complete this exercise using the free
# Twitter API access. Higher access levels or paid tiers are required to get
# follower/friend metrics needed for this task.
