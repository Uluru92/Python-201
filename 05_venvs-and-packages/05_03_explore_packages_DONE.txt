Do an online search for interesting Python packages on PyPI.
You can search for something you're interested to do with your programming
skills and add "Python package" to the search query.
- What do you find?
- Create a new virtual environment and install the package.
- Check out its documentation and their "Getting Started" guide
  and code examples, if there are any.
- Can you get some basic functionality of the package to work locally?
